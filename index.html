							<p>I’m from Hangzhou where is located in the southeast of China. I’m studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I’m a kind of a rookie in the computer and IT area, this is my first time to study IT. I’ve never touched it before, computers used to be just entertainment for me. My favorite sport is basketball; I watch the NBA as well. Also, I play League of Legend and some video games on PS4.</p>

							<h2>Interest in IT </h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Programming, code and AI are very attractive to me. For the first time that I was introduced to the word “IT” is the movie “The Matrix” and the video game “Watch Dog”. When I was reading in high school, my class mate recommends the movie and video game to me. I felt really exciting about what happened in the movie and game. About “Watch Dog”, the protagonist is a hacker, he lives in a world completely controlled by the network. He entered the command to the equipment by his phone. I use this example is not mean I want to be a hacker, the most interesting thing is it changed my understand of computer and Internet. That’s the reasons why I feel curious and interest in IT.</p>

								<li class="icon fa-map-marker">GPS</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">programming</li>
							</ul>
							<p>About the reasons why I choose to come to RMIT, first of all, Bachelor of IT is one of the RMIT’s ace major. Also, RMIT is a good choice to learn technology. It includes “Technology” in the name of university. In addition, I want to learn “IT” in RM “IT”, this was the first time I thought of RMIT as the university I would go to in the future. However, I’m still lost in IT area because I didn’t decide where to go from here, such as cloud, programming, Web programming and app develop. Thus, I’m expected to decide the item what I’m good and helpful to my career during my studies.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>According to the name of my idea job “Microsoft SQL Developer”, it will require some knowledges and skills from database development. Even if I’m a new student in Database concepts and it is the first time I know SQL Developer in this course. But my ideal job can help me confirm my direction of studying, Data is quite interesting because it is very important in Internet, data can be equal to information. So I’m attractive about transforming and aligning data which is helpful to my career in the future. I’m not going to feel painful when I doing this job probably. The applicants will require at least 5 years’ experience with SQL Server and strong skills in writing T-SQL which means they need to be very familiar with the language of SQL. Also, the experience of some professional application are required, such as Power BI, SSRS and SSAS. The applicants are also need to have deep understanding of cloud technologies. In addition, business analysis skills are normally required for a business man, they have to know complicated business process. As I said before, this is my first year of IT, there are lot of knowledge need to learn and try a lot of new stuff. Therefore, it will be a lengthy process for me. However, about my plan how to achieve my goal, the first year in university for me is significant, because I can learn a lot of knowledge and skills from class and lecture. For example, in database concepts, how to use SQL developer and Dia(Graphing application). Then, practicing in tutorial is also important, it help me built deep understanding of my knowledge and skills. So achieve high score in assignment is a good result of practicing. In the 2th and 3th years, I will do more practice based on what I learned, so I can have more experience of those applications.</p>

											<p><strong>Auditory:</strong>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</p>
											<p><strong>Tactile:</strong>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still. As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>

							<p>   1.	the tests are to test my personality and learning style, I answered those question based on my situation. All three reports show that I tend to be introverted but willing to share to friends after familiar with them. However, those result felt a little bit real to me, every sentence seems to make sense.</p>

							<p>  </p>

							<p>   2.	From my point of view, in a team, the most significant thing is “responsibility”, the result showed me even if I liked the delay, I still can finish my missions before due. Also, there are a lot of information in my result, but I will make those as condition to myself in order to be a good group member.</p>
							<p>  </p>
							<p>   3. Respecting each teammate are important when forming a team. I always respect my friends and teammates, when they need help I usually give my hand to them. I never think I’m better than anyone, everyone should be equal. Taking suggestion from other people is a good way to improve and have an entirely different idea.</p>

							<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Nowadays, with the development of technology, people can't live without smart phones any more. Therefore, it is a good chance to develop some new app. App Store is a big online market, there are many different apps can be downloaded. As far as we know, applications were always designed for making people’s life easier. I want to invent a game software for some specific crowd, it can help people decrease their pressure. When they running this game, there will be some bubble swing in the screen, once the user clips the bubble, the music will start to play. People need to set their favourite music in the app. </p>
             <p> I’m a student so I know clearly how much pressure a student will bear in study and it is inevitable. Based on the smartphone has spread to everyone and people will always felt pressure, so I want to develop this game to help them decrease their pressure and relax when they are nervous. As we all know, stress can come from any aspect, it is universal in this society. Therefore, it is necessary to have such a game software in the App Store to help relieve pressure. </p>
						 <p>First of all, my project will be simple in visual perception which will be pretty and clean. Because I do not want to users feel more anxious when they start to play this game. The first step to user is set up their personal information, such as gender, ages, position and preferred colour. I will use a monochrome background which is based on the preferred colour that the user has entered in their profile. The reasons why I decided to use monochrome background is because it goes well with bubbles, the stereo sense and shading will work best. Also, user will need to put/download their favourite music in to the library. About this process, I will try to cooperate with some of the popular music software companies, such as QQ music and Spotify, so we can have access to download music from them which is a very important step. I will also put some playlists as advice to people who are not sure what kind of music they want to listen to, it based on their profile like ages and position. After finished setting profile, background and music (it always can be changed in setting), the bubble will start to appear on the screen and the number of bubble are based on the user’s phone type, such as the phone’s screen size, I don’t want to have either too much bobble or not enough. I’m afraid that too many bubbles will cause my project to take up too much CPU space on the user’s phone, which will cause the phone to get stuck and get hot quickly, it is also bad for the phone’s battery. If the bubbles are not enough, even if there is no burden on the phone, the user may just start poking bubbles and end up running out of them quickly. That’s not good for user experience. Once the bubble starts to appear, the game stated. The amount of bubbles is fixed, which means when a bubble is broken, there is a new bubble appear immediately. Therefore, player can prick endless bubbles as they want and their music will start to play since they poked the first bubble. Maybe for the people who just want to try this game, it might make them feel a little boring and stupid. But for the people who are under pressure, is a really good way to relieve their stress, and music can play a good auxiliary effect that make the overall effect of double. The only thing users should pay attention to is not to pop the bubble so hard that the touch of function of the mobile phone screen becomes not sensitive. The project will not assume this responsibility.</p>
						 <p>About the tools and technologies, firstly, eclipse is the basic programming application so it has to be required. Also, Android and IOS the two different system in smart phone required different tools and technologies. For Android Eclipse, ADT and SDK is used together for developing. For IOS, XCODE is necessary.</p>
						 <p> Doing this project are required rich experience of using smart phone and familiar with everything in the phone. Also, the basic language is necessary in develop a new application, such as C, JAVA and Objective-C, the developer also required familiar with those languages.</p>
						 <p> If the project is successful, which means this is good project. It really helped people relieve their stress by their phone. So the aim of this application is achieved. The user information in the database are worked, it suggested the music to the people who have different ages and position. The background correctly run and used the colour which user filled in to the profile. Everything can run in the correct way.</p>
